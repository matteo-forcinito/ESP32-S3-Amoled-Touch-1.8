 * Capacitive touch (FT3168).
 *
 * The chip pulls its INT pin low while a finger is on the glass. We use
 * that pin both as an interrupt (read the touch right away instead of
 * polling all the time) and as a wake-up source from light sleep.
 *
 * In "monitor" mode the chip scans slowly and uses very little power, but
 * still pulls INT low when touched: we use it while the screen is off.
