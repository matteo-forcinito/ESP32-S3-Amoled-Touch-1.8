 * The AMOLED panel (SH8601 on the 1.8" board).

 * AMOLED pixels make their own light: a black pixel is simply off and
 * costs (almost) nothing. That is why the UI uses black backgrounds and
 * why the always-on face is mostly black at low brightness.
 *
 * Drawing is asynchronous: display_draw() queues the pixels on the QSPI bus
 * (DMA) and returns; `done` (from display_init) is called from an
 * interrupt when the transfer finished and the buffer can be reused.
