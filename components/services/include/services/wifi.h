/*
 * Wi-Fi, switched on only while someone needs it.
 *
 * Wi-Fi is the most power-hungry part of the chip (~80-100 mA while on), so
 * it is reference counted: the radio, the weather, the time sync and the web
 * page "acquire" it and "release" it when done. A few seconds after the last
 * release the radio is switched off.
 *
 *     if (wifi_acquire(15000) == ESP_OK)     // joins the best known network
 *     {
 *         ... HTTP requests ...
 *         wifi_release();
 *     }
 *
 * Known networks are kept in NVS (up to 8). At boot they are merged with
 * /sdcard/config/wifi.txt ("ssid = password" lines) and with /networks.json
 * from the old Arduino launcher.
