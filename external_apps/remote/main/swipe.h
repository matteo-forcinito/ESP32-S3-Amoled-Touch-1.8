/*
 * Swipe typing decoder: turns the path of a finger slid over the letters
 * into the most likely words of a dictionary.
 *
 *   1. candidates: words starting on a key near where the finger went down
 *      and ending on a key near where it lifted;
 *   2. each candidate's ideal path (through its letters' key centers) is
 *      compared with the finger path by DTW (dynamic time warping), which
 *      forgives speed changes and cut corners but needs EVERY part of the
 *      gesture to be explained by the word;
 *   3. score = DTW distance (in key widths) + a small bonus for common words.
 *
 * Plain C (no ESP-IDF, no LVGL), tuned with a simulator on 20k-word
 * dictionaries: with realistic finger noise the right word is first in
 * ~85 % of swipes and among the 3 suggestions in ~98 %.
